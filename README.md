# Movie-Poster-Genre-Prediction
Overview

This project predicts a movie’s genre using only its poster.
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning (ResNet / MobileNet), the system learns visual patterns from thousands of movie posters and classifies them into genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, etc.

This project demonstrates strong skills in:

Computer Vision

Transfer Learning

Deep Learning Model Training

Exploratory Data Analysis

Image Classification Pipelines

Model Deployment (Streamlit/FastAPI optional)

🚀 Features

Predicts movie genre directly from poster image

Uses Transfer Learning (ResNet-50 / MobileNetV2) for high accuracy

Efficient preprocessing pipeline

Visualization of genre distribution

Data augmentation to boost generalization

Confusion matrix + classification report

Trained on 8,252 posters

Supports top-3 genre prediction

Includes Jupyter notebooks for:

Data exploration

Model training

Model evaluation

Ready-to-run Streamlit UI (optional)
